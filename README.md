# CodeWizard

It's not a virus, I promise. It does create and run .bat files, but it's seriously not a virus. Qt (c++) just sucks.

CodeWizard is a custom Code Editor / IDE designed by Adam Mather. The main point behind CodeWizard is an editor like Python's IDLE but with a better dark mode. That was seriously the whole motivation behind the project. As I continued I decided to support more languages than just Python, mainly because I prefer the interface and philosophy to modern (better) IDEs (think VSCode, etc).

CodeWizard has an optional filetree on the left. Here's an example without.

## Language Server Protocol

CodeWizard Version 8.0.0 and onwards support LSPs. Specifically, you can specify the command to start an LSP for CodeWizard to use for the current language. See the help menu in CodeWizard for more info on how to setup an LSP.

**Running Code**

When CodeWizard attempts to execute the program you have created, it will first create a .bat file in a temporary folder. This .bat file will be written with the appropriate commands to run the program. After it is created, CodeWizard will run it. I tried so hard to not have to use a .bat file, but whatever.
